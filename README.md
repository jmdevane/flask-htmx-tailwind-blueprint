1. Clone the repository.

    `git clone https://github.com/jmdevane/flask-blueprint-boilerplate.git`

2. Setup virtual environment.

3. Install dependencies (with virtual environment active)

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Set Flask app secret key (for securing client-side sessions).

    ```
        >>> import secrets
        >>> secrets.token_hex(16)
        'da08208f2fd9b29c21e6655757ce4f9a'
    ```

    Either set key as an environment variable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` (current state) or edit `config.py` directly:

    `   SECRET_KEY = 'da08208f2fd9b29c21e6655757ce4f9a'`

5. Launch development app server.

    `python run.py`

6. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` (or ip listed in console if running remotely) to view.
